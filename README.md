# Ratatui Documentation

<img align="left" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125200832?s=128&v=4" alt="ratatui logo">

This is the documentation project for [Ratatui](https://github.com/tui-rs-revival/ratatui), a Rust
library to build rich terminal user interfaces and dashboards. Note that this book is supplementary
to the technical documentation, and not a substitute for it. This is more of a guide book to help our
users understand how to build a TUI with Ratatui. If you are looking for documentation on specific
structs, enums, traits, methods, etc., please visit our [technical documentation](https://docs.rs/ratatui/0.21.0/ratatui/)
on docs.rs.
