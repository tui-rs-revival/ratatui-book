[Ratatui](https://github.com/tui-rs-revival/ratatui) is a Rust library for creating terminal UIs. It
was forked from [TUI-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs/) to continue the maintenance of the
project.

This documentation is a work in progress and is currently very incomplete. Come help us out at
